traditional risk assessment model based on Kent scoring method and Analytic hierarchy process
--------------
initially used in risk assessment of urban gas pipeline. Suppose we have We have a data sample, which contains the attribute                information of thousands of pipelines, such as pipe diameter, pressure, length, etc., so we can use the data analysis method to           predict the possible risk of each pipeline and identify which pipelines or areas are high risk.
### The object is not limited to gas pipeline, but can be any urban lifeline pipeline, or even any object requiring risk assessment with characteristic dataÔºÅ
